*DESCRIPTION*

The main goal is to build a predictive model for credit card fraud detection, identifying fraudulent transactions from a dataset containing real-world transaction records. Given the highly imbalanced nature of fraud data—where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones—the challenge lies in developing a model that accurately detects fraud without generating excessive false alarms. The process involves data preprocessing, handling class imbalance using techniques like feature selection, and training a classification model Random Forest . The model’s performance will be evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score to ensure it effectively distinguishes between genuine and fraudulent transactions.
